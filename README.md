## 💭 Description

This is a UI application for tracking the daily level of proteins, fats and carbohydrates in the body.

The application can select the necessary diet based on your goals (lose or gain weight), taking into account the characteristics of your body or personal preferences. For example, you can indicate that you are allergic to lactose and the application will not add products containing lactose to your diet.

The application can provide you with a training program and monitor its implementation, as well as offer to subscribe to channels of trainers, nutritionists and other professionals who will help you make the shape of your dreams.
